# Build Tools Playground 👷‍♂️

Play with various build scenarios of a simple web app, which are based on:

* Bash
* npm
* webpack
* Parcel

## Five steps to understand the "Why?" behind the modern front-end build process 

### 0 - OS only 💻

In this example I want to show you that it's possible to "build" a web app using nothing more than utils that OS gives you for free. I'm fetching libs like jQuery and lodash using `curl`, I'm `unzip`ping them, and then `cat`ing into one file.

### 1 - Package manager 📦

In the second example I want to show you what kind of things we gain after introducing a proper package manager to our build stack. This example is focused on `npm` and cross-platform libs like `rimraf`.

### 2 - Build tools 🛠

Third example is dedicated to Webpack and its capabilities.

### 3 - Build tools + Extras 🔥

Fourth example is about extending Webpack's capabilities by introducing loaders and plugins that let you import previously unknown formats of files and enhance your build process.

### 4 - Simpler, please! 🧘‍♀️

This example is about going back to basics - what's the simplest possible tool one could use today to build a web app? Spoiler alert - there's a big chance that the answer is called `Parcel`.
